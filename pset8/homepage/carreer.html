                        I work with development of powder coatings, based in a salmple or a color chart,following the
                        quality parameters, the coating must have good adhesion, good wethering reistance, scratching resistance, etc.

                        I always was into tecnology, I'm used to play games since I was a kid, so when kid I did learn how to do use the internet
                        and solve some hardware and softwareproblems. In the school my favorite subject were chemistry, so when I finished the High School
                        I decided to start my graduation in chemical engeneering, and I finished my graduation after 5 years in 2020.
                        In 2021 my girlfriend was in need of a new PC to work with her projects of interior designs, i a had some knowledge of hardware components,
                        and I build a custom PC for her, I really enjoyed this procces and decided to build my own PC, cause it was always a dream for me when younger,
                        but i did not had money before. While all this things going on, I was searching for job opportunities, but my searches resulted just in
                        "web development", "software development", and not something like "coatings development", i didn't know what it was, so just ignored.
                        The turnaway happened when I was searching for hardware components in a promo app and I saw the post for the CS50 course, and I decided to make the course
                        just by curiosity. Through this course I discovered that I like tecnology and programming so badly, and now I am in my leaning process to be a programmer
                        as soon as possible!
